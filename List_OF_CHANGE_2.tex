\section{List of changes in the second revised paper} % (fold)
The entire article has been polished. Main changes can be found in the following:
% section section_name (end)
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Page 1, line 36: write "billion" with small initial; 
    \item Page 1, line 50, 55: remove the round brackets for the references;
    \item Page 3, line 51: replace the units with normal letters (mK)
    \item Page 4, line 18, line 20: insert a blank between the number and the unit (32.5 °C, 7.5 °C and 25 °C);
    \item Page 4, line 26: remove the round brackets for the references;
    \item Page 4, line 25: \textbf{rebuttal}---(for emissivity quantification, here we have just mentioned that the observed intensity is independent on the direction between the camera and the inside wall, which will not make an influence on the final panorama. Therefore the emissivity value is unused in the whole computation [image processing], nor in the ATP standard test)
    \item Page 5, line 6: add the explanations of all parameters in eq 5 and figure 3;
    \item Page 6, figure 3: increase the figure size;
    \item Page 7, figure 5: add explanation of the figure in its caption;
    \item Page 7, table 1: rewrite the units with small letters;

    \item Page 10, figure 12: 
    \item Page 9, line 58 to 60: number the equations;
    \item Page 10, lines 12, 19 and 36: number the equations;
    \item Page 10, lines 36 to 38: add the units also in the interim calculations of the equations;
    \item Page 11, complete the references 1, 2, 3, 17.
\end{enumerate}
